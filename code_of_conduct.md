GitHub Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Standards
We will prioritize the safety and well-being of all members of our community by:

Being respectful and empathetic towards others
Using welcoming and inclusive language
Accepting constructive criticism and feedback
Focusing on what is best for the community
Showing empathy towards other community members
Our Responsibilities
Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. They also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@github.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.

By following this code of conduct, GitHub aims to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone can collaborate and contribute to open-source projects without fear of harassment or discrimination.
